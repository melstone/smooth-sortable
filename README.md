# Smooth sortable

Smooth sortable for jQuery. Trying to bring iOS class sortables to your browser.

Prototype and messy, but very simple.

## TODO

- Document the logic
- Use transforms instead of position:relative
- Delegate event handling so items can be added
- Make an actual plugin with an API
- Accessibility
- Bugs
